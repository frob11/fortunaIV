# fortunaIV -- Keep track of personal financial status
In order to learn apple's SWIFT programming language and to get acquainted with git and github, I've decided to translate a Csharp programm I once wrote to Swift on MacOS.
I doubt whether this program will be of any use to anyone else but me.  But I didn't want to pay GitHub licenses to keep my development private.  So I'm just throwing it public.

I've created the original program to keep track of my money which, for several reasons, is kept on multiple bankaccounts.
Main functions are:
- Keep track of all the money on all bankaccounts (Overview of the year)
- Keep track of daily/monthly/yearly/ recurring and one-time expenses in order to predict how much is left at the end of the month
- Keep track of loans

Since I'm a very slow developer and I don't expect collaborations, it will take quite some time before all this functionality is included in this new version

Kind Regards
Frank
